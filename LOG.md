Change: establish the repository control plane, immutable task leases,
non-overlapping write scopes, handoff contract, PR scope validation, and a
read-only assignment watcher. Acceptance uses a strict command-shape allowlist
and every task has a focused test-first CI route; the history scanner covers
the repository's supported credential families without printing matched
values.
Why: Claude and Codex diverged without a shared queue, ownership gate, current
state ledger, or GitHub checks; Claude's merge analysis and newer tail existed
only locally.
Evidence: the new governance test failed before implementation with
`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`; post-change evidence is recorded in the CTRL-001
handoff and PR checks. The current focused governance suite passes 76/76.
weakened_checks: none.
