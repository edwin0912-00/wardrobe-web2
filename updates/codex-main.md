Agent ID: codex-main
Task ID: BETA-LOOK-NEXT-ACTIONS-001
Protocol ACK: 00cb600
State: BLOCKED_DEPLOY
Rationale/decision: the operator requested one visual approval screen before
the real saved-look choice flow is altered. It is therefore a standalone
non-functional preview, not a mock video/camera implementation.
Scope: only `web/public/choice-universe-preview.html` and its focused test.
No provider call, camera permission, profile mutation or navigation binding.
Evidence command: node --test test/web/choice-universe-preview.test.js (2/2 PASS).
Deploy blocker: immutable product-release build stops at pre-existing invalid
editorial preview sidecar `editorial.edwin_novak.organic_contrast` before it
can package the preview. No bypass/manual file copy was used.
weakened_checks: none.

State: READY_FOR_BETA_DEPLOY
Exact product commit: `969bc57`.
Deployment blocker: `tools/lib/deployment-target.mjs` permits only
`https://iwas.madeforthisjob.com/api/health`, which is a separately protected
target and not the beta domain. No substitution, manual copy or release was
attempted. The next safe action is for the beta release owner to provide or
approve the exact beta-targeted activation path, then visually smoke tap
selection on one mobile viewport and one desktop viewport.
Help request: NONE.

Implementation checkpoint: `914ebf6` replaces the equal three-card row in
the actual saved-look panel with a single amber primary action, four compact
category modules and one full-width Real-time Look action. Standard background
and Create Universe now enter their existing picker on the correct tab. Live
is unchanged and executable; Improve and Fashion Video are disabled and make
no false transport/provider claim. Cache references for app, picker and result
CSS were versioned with this change.
Focused proof: `node --test test/web/profile-ui-flow.test.js` — 9/9 PASS;
`node --test test/web/atelier-choice-prototype.test.js` — 3/3 PASS;
`git diff --check` PASS. The new control is absent from parent `f6fde02`, so
the added focused assertion is a real regression test, not a pre-existing
green test.
Visual check: inspected the isolated static surface and its action dock. A full
profile smoke remains pending beta activation; the isolated clone lacks the
Fastify dependency required to launch its API/profile runtime locally.
Deploy blocker: deployment target enforcement still accepts only protected
`iwas.madeforthisjob.com`, never beta. No target substitution or manual
release was attempted.
weakened_checks: none.
Next action: release owner supplies the exact beta-targeted activation path,
then run one saved-look mobile and desktop smoke of Background, Photoshoot and
Real-time Look.

Implementation checkpoint: the prototype composes the paper, two swatches,
lamp, replaceable look slot and five controls from independent DOM/CSS layers.
Selecting a control updates only the local explanation and pressed state; no
media, profile or provider path is invoked.
Focused proof: `node --test test/web/atelier-choice-prototype.test.js` — 3/3
PASS; `git diff --check` PASS; inline interaction script parses with `node
--check`.
weakened_checks: none.
Next action: resolve the separately owned sidecar-contract defect, then build
and activate the exact preview SHA for a visual beta smoke.

Agent ID: codex-main
Task ID: BETA-LOOK-ACTION-UI-002
Protocol ACK: 00cb600
State: STARTED
Rationale/decision: operator rejected equal-weight decorative action cards.
The production saved-look panel will retain its working scene and Live routes,
but expose their different meanings with one recommended primary action and
four compact, labelled choices. The visual treatment may use restrained accent
light only as a category signal, never as a false readiness indicator.
Scope: exact paths declared in UPDATE.md.
Risk: Improve and Fashion Video are not executable product routes. Their UI
must state that status and must not invoke a provider, camera, persistence, or
mock generation.
Evidence planned: focused profile UI tests plus mobile and desktop browser QA.
weakened_checks: none.
Help request: NONE.

Agent ID: codex-main
Task ID: BETA-ATELIER-CHOICE-001
Protocol ACK: 814556f
State: STARTED
Rationale/decision: operator selected the atelier composition but requires all
visual parts to remain independently addressable in the product UI. The new
prototype is isolated from the existing saved-look flow so it cannot claim
generation, camera, or persistence behavior.
Scope: only the task-reserved standalone prototype and its focused test.
Risk: a user photograph must not be baked into a committed UI asset; the
prototype therefore renders an explicit replaceable approved-look slot.
Evidence: direct operator request and the supplied visual reference.
weakened_checks: none.
Help request: NONE.
